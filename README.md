# Snake-Game

Description:
Welcome to Snake Game: Apple Collector! This classic game puts you in control of a hungry snake on a mission to collect as many delicious apples as possible. Navigate through the maze-like grid, avoiding obstacles and yourself as you grow longer with each apple eaten.

How to Play:
Controls:

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake's movement.
You can also use W, A, S, D keys for directional control.
Objective:

Your goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's own body.
Each apple you eat will increase your snake's length, making it more challenging to navigate.
Game Over:

The game ends if you collide with a wall or the snake's body.
Your final score is determined by the number of apples you've collected.
Scoring:

Each apple collected adds one point to your score.
Challenge yourself and friends to beat high scores!
